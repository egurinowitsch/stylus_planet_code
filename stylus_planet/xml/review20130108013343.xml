	<comments>This stylus writes accurately everytime all the time. Not like other rubber tipped pens that only write for the 	 	first week or two and then fail. If the nib breaks it can also be replaced very cheaply. This is the only stylus that I know 	where you can do that. It is the Mont Blanc of iPad stylus pens!</comments>
